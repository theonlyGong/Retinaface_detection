# Retinaface

----------------INTRODUCTION------------
Basically, Retinaface has 3 branches for classes regression, anchors location regression and landmarks regression. 
However, this network is only utilised for 68 key points detection,so it cut off other two branches. 
Noted: All these codes are only for test. If you wanna check original code of Retinaface, go to this link:<http://github.com/bubbliiiing/retinaface-pytorch>
